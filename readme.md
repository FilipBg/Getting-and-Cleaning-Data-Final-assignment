Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the final programming assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data course.

There is only one script, run_analysis.R. To run it successfully, you should download required dataset
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and UNZIP it into your working directory. Note how in the first line it is assigned as a new working directory, so all file names should remain the same.
It requires data.package and reshape2 libraries to be installed.



You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CODEBOOK.md file.
